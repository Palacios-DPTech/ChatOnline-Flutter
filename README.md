<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>

<p>
    This project was a simple Chat made with Flutter and Firebase .<br>
    With this application you can chat with people, acessing it via your Google Account, sending and receiving messages and photos, and entering different accounts with each         message you send.<br>
    I used Firebase, noSQL and in real time, which gives you flexibility, easy development, manipulation and structuring.<br>
    This application is in version 1.0. Ready for another one!🚀 <br>

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p>
   In this project was challenging for me because is the first time that I use Firebase but it was very good for my learning about backend, and I loved this experience of          developing one on Firebase, which I had heard about, but never created anything.<br>
